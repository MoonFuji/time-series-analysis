# Time Series Analysis: ECG Data Classification

This project is part of a college group assignment focused on the application of machine learning techniques for time series analysis, specifically for classifying Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The goal is to accurately classify patients' heartbeat data into two categories: sick (-1) or healthy (1), with a particular emphasis on the recall score for the sick class to ensure high sensitivity in identifying sick patients.

## Project Summary

The project involves training multiple models and selecting the best one based on the recall score for the sick class. The recall score is crucial for this project because it measures the model's ability to correctly identify sick patients, which is more important than correctly identifying healthy ones in this context. The best model identified for this task is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The ECG data is preprocessed to normalize the features, making the model training more effective.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Multiple models were trained, and their performance was evaluated based on the recall score for the sick class. The KNN model showed the best performance.
- **Test Data Prediction**: The trained KNN model is used to predict the class (sick or healthy) of unseen test data.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (pandas, sklearn, numpy) installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `TSA_Model_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in the "Most important cells" section to test the best model on your test data.
